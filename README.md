Just a plain Tetris with some options.
In this version you can:
- change number of the game field's width and height
- set initial block fall speed
- optionally show hints on what figure will be next
- optionally set speed increase on each 10 points
- optionally show feedback messages (depends on how much lines you fill)
- turn music/sounds on/off

All arts and music made by me, sound effects were taken from non-commercial sound libraries.
- Slick and LWJGL were used to manage the sound part of the game

executables folder contains fat .jar file to run on linux OS, dedicated .exe file to run on Windows,
both created with jarSplice.
This game is almost the first I've done in Java, as I'm not a professional programmer
